# Phase 3 Project

For this project, the requirements were to implement a Python CLI Application that includes a database created through ORM methods. In this app, we are modeling a music library using artists, albums, and songs. For every Artist, they include a name and a genre. Every Album has a title and song count, as well as referencing the id of the artist. Every Song has a title and artist id, but does not need to have an album id. Songs can be "singles" with an empty album id.

The CLI functions for this program include ORM methods to create objects, delete objects, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute. Additional functions include: Finding the number of albums and songs by artist, listing all albums of an artist, listing all songs in an album, and listing all songs and singles by an artist. The user will interface with this app by selecting options through different menus for each class (artist, album, and song).

Future functionality of this interface could allow for users to create playlists and include references to song ids, genres, etc. The database could be extended to add user tables as well as allowing for more metadata related to songs and albums.
