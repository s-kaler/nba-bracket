# Phase 3 Project

For this project, the requirements were to implement a Python CLI Application that includes a database created through ORM methods. To begin, simply run the python script for lib/cli.py. In this app, I have designed a simple game based off Pokemon. The goal of this game is to catch new pokemon and get a higher party score and earn money. The game starts with letting the player choose a starting pokemon. That pokemon is automatically added to the party. Next, the player is brought to the main menu, where they are shown their available money, pokeballs, and current party. Each Player starts with $1000 and 5 pokeballs.

From the main menu, the player can choose from a list of options that include: Viewing the pokemon in their team, catching new pokemon, viewing all pokemon in the database, and buying more pokeballs. From the team menu, the player can chance nicknames of any pokemon, rearrange their party, or release pokemon for money. From there, the player can back out to the main menu. If the player wants to catch pokemon, they must use their pokeballs. If a pokemon is caught, they must give it a nickname. The more pokemon a player catches, the higher the party level goes up, which makes it easier to catch new pokemon.

The player can also view the list of all pokemon in the pokedex. Currently, there is no way to change the pokedex through the CLI, since it is out of the scope of the game. Future additions could be to allow pokemon to battle and level up as well.
