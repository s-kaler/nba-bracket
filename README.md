# Phase 3 Project

For this project, the requirements were to implement a Python CLI Application that includes a database created through ORM methods. In this app, I have designed a simple game based off Pokemon. The goal of this game is to catch new pokemon and get a higher party score and earn money. The game starts with letting the player choose a starting pokemon. That pokemon is automatically added to the party. Next, the player is brought to the main menu, where they are shown their available money, pokeballs, and current party. Each Player starts with $1000 and 5 pokeballs.

From the main menu, the player can choose from a list of options that include: Viewing the pokemon in their team, catching new pokemon, viewing all pokemon in the database, and buying more pokeballs. From the team menu, the player can rearrange his party.
